## Overview

Albularyo is a web application designed to help users diagnose potential diseases based on their symptoms. The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can select symptoms and receive possible diagnoses. Additionally, the application features an AI chatbot that uses the Gemini API to dynamically respond to user queries based on the diseases data.

## Features

1. **Symptom-Based Diagnosis**:
    - Users can select symptoms from a predefined list or enter additional symptoms manually.
    - The application matches the provided symptoms with a list of diseases and returns possible diagnoses.
    - Each diagnosis includes the disease name, ICD code, and a link to more information if available.

2. **AI Chatbot**:
    - The application includes a chatbot interface where users can interact with an AI assistant.
    - The chatbot uses the Gemini API to dynamically utilize the diseases JSON file and respond to user queries.
    - The chatbot can provide information about diseases, symptoms, and other medical-related queries.
